# Portfolio Website Project

This repository contains my personal **portfolio website**, built using **Streamlit** and Python.  
The purpose of this project is to:
- Showcase my **resume, career background, and technical skills**  
- Demonstrate **example projects** (data engineering, BI, dimensional modeling, Streamlit apps, etc.)  
- Provide a **clean, professional, lightweight website** that I can host online for recruiters, hiring managers, and networking.

## Key Details
- Framework: **Streamlit**
- Python Version: 3.10+
- Environment: Virtual environment (`venv`)  
- Source Control: GitHub
- Target Hosting: TBD (likely **Streamlit Community Cloud** for free hosting, or other simple hosting options if needed)
- Styling: Minimalist, professional
- Possible Extras: 
  - Power BI examples (screenshots, or embedded reports if practical)  
  - Example notebooks, SQL queries, or links to GitHub repos
  - Resume PDF download option

## What I Expect for this project
- Writing clean, modular Python + Streamlit code
- Best practices for project structure and folder organization
- Component layout (tabs, sidebars, navigation, etc.)
- Integrating downloadable content (resume, project files, etc.)
- Optimizing for readability, maintainability, and professional presentation
- Keeping code modern and compatible with Python 3.10+ and Streamlit best practices

Think of this project as a **personal resume + portfolio app** rather than a business app.  
The priority is **professional presentation and ease of maintenance**, not complex functionality.
